                    W3Schools is a great resource as an introduction to nearly all things needed to know
                    in order to author good web pages. This is of value because there are a lot of tutorials
                    and examples of web languages, including HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, SQL, JSON, Node. Anyone
                    working on the web will find this a valuable resource for authoring web apps. I can use
                    this site as a resource to look up the things I need as well as working through tutuorials
                    to learn new things, as well as refreshing what I have forgotten.<br>

                    <li><p><a href="http://codecademy.com">Codecademy</a><br>
                    Codecademy provides a lot of content in the form of tutorials on a large selection of programming
                    languages. Other courses are offered as well such as a Web Development course, a Data Science course,
                    and even a Computer Science course. The tutorials are very really well designed. They are clean, aesthetic, 
                    are intuitive and easy to follow, and full of information. Enyone getting started in programming would find 
                    so many benefits from exploring this site. Even more experienced programmers can take courses that will grow 
                    their skills in different areas. I have been using Codecademy for a while and will continue to use it to help 
                    myself better learn the concepts of programming by actually applying them in step-by-step tutorials.<br>

                    <li><p><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/">freeCodeCamp</a><br>
                    FreeCodeCamp has over 6,000 tutorials for programmers and people new to programming. The learning content
                    is broken up into certificates that you can achieve if you complete all of the tutorials within. The approximate
                    time it will take to complete a tutorial is also listed. For example, there is a Responsive Web Design 
                    certification that takes 300 hours to complete. The site is free and is a great resource for people both going 
                    into programming and those who already are but may want or need to learn another skill. I can use this site 
                    along with Codecademy to learn how to program while also getting to apply what I have learned.<br>

                    <li><p><a href="https://javascript.info/">The Modern JavaScript Tutorial</a><br>
                    This site offers a vast amount of information on JavaScript. You can start from the ground up or find specific 
                    information. There is a lot of content included and each course is very informative. Someone who has never used
                    JavaScript could start here, and likewise, someone who already knows JavaScript could use this site as a resource
                    when needing a refresher on different JavaScript topics or learning new ones. Since a lot of my classes will be 
                    using JavaScript to code, and I will definitely need to know it in order to apply for jobs, this is a helpful resource
                    I can use to improve my JavaScript knowledge and abilities.<br>

                    <li><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/">LinkedInLearning</a><br>
                    LinkedIn Learning has a vast amount of informative videos on pretty much anything you need to know in the 
                    world of programming. The content is sectioned into courses that are broken up into short videos. You can choose
                    to either watch the whole video series (the total length of the course is listed) or you can choose to watch just 
                    a couple of the videos from the course. This site is a wonderful resource for anyone looking for information in this 
                    field (or various other fields that are also part of the website such as photography). With access to this site,
                    you don't need to go looking for tutorials and informational videos on YouTube, everything is located right on this site. 
                    It makes learning the concepts even more accessible. I will be using this site throughout my time at Bellevue College to 
                    aid in understanding various concepts.<br>

                    <li><p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN Web Docs</a><br>
                    MDN Web Docs is a fantastic resource for any information a web developer may be looking for. There are guides, courses,
                    and tutorials available such as a course that walks you through web development. There is also a lot of information available on 
                    a number of programming languages. The whole site is full of information and is very content-heavy. Anyone either starting with
                    programming or who has already been programming for a while can find useful and up-to-date information on this site. If you have a 
                    question on anything programming-related, it can probably be answered by searching on this site. I will be using MDN Web Docs
                    throughout my time programming to find information on anything I may be looking for, whether it's JavaScript syntax or learning
                    about the CSS box model.<br>
