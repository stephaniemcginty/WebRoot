            W3Schools is a great resource as an introduction to nearly all things needed to know
            in order to author good web pages. This is of value because there are a lot of tutorials
            and examples of web languages, including HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, SQL, JSON, Node. Anyone
            working on the web will find this a valuable resource for authoring web apps. I can use
            this site as a resource to look up the things I need as well as working through tutuorials
            to learn new things, as well as refreshing what I have forgotten.<br>
